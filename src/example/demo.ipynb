This can be directly computed using the formula for the sum of the first \\(n\\) positive integers, which is \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\). For \\(n = 100\\), Jo's sum is \\(\\frac{100 \\cdot 101}{2} = 5050\\).<analyze>\\nLet's analyze the Paragraph 1 step by step: 1. The problem states that Jo adds all integers from 1 to 100. The formula used is correct (n(n+1)/2). For n=100, the calculation is 100*101/2 = 5050. This is accurate. The reasoning here is correct.\\n</analyze>\\n<verify>\\nLet's use python code to find any potential error:\\n```python\\nn = 100\\njo_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\\nprint(jo_sum)  # Should output 5050\\n```\\n[Code Output]\\n\\n```\\n5050\\n```\\n\n",
